# TreeAnarchy 
### __(AKA Unlimited Trees: Rebooted)__

#### Requires: Harmony 2.0.x ported over to Cities Skylines by [Bofomer](https://github.com/boformer) -- [Github](https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony)

TreeAnarchy is a reboot of the original Unlimited Trees Mod with focus on performance and basic support for mods such as Tree Snapping and Tree Anarchy. Both Tree Snapping/Tree Anarchy mods used detours to realize their functions. Thus it is one of the primary goals of this project to convert them to use Harmony in this mod.

This mod is a complete rewrite, taking out bloats and streamlining the serialization process. The concept is the same, and I wouldn't have been able to write this code this fast without the original Unlimited Trees mod creators. Thanks to

This mod is currently __ALPHA__, with the following functions:
- [x] Support for more than 262144 trees
- [x] Support Tree Snapping with functionality just like Prop Snapping
- [ ] Support for random tree rotation
- [ ] Performance tuning to attempt to increase fps to support more trees

I need supporters/volunteers to help debug/code to make this mod even better. If you want to contribute, please contact me anytime.

Anyways, these codes are open to the public, as its a hobby of mine. If you wish to contribute to the codes, please join in.

IMPORTANT!! As always, create a new save!!! This mod creates a new version of saved datas. Original mod formats loading are supported, but then are saved into the new format.
