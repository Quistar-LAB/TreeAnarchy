TreeAnarchy v0.1 (AKA Unlimited Trees Mod: Rebooted)

I called this mod TreeAnarchy, since it incorporated concepts from TreeAnarchy and TreeSnapping. This mod supports tree snapping, which I've wondered why the original mod creator never tried.
This mod is a complete rewrite, taking out bloats and streamlining the serialization process. The concept is the same, and I wouldn't have been able to write this code this fast without the original Unlimited Trees mod creators.

There are incompletes in this mod as it is at its alpha stage.

1. burning trees test
2. tree snapping test

Tree anarchy support is included in this mod, otherwise tree snapping cannot be achieved. Thus, you don't need the original tree anarchy mod. Prop & tree anarchy includes patches to the same methods, so my proposal is to separate tree anarchy and prop anarchy.

I'm now also working on prop anarchy to support more props (although its not my top priority as there is Procedural Object)

Anyways, these codes are open to the public, as its a hobby of mine. If you wish to contribute to the codes, please join in.
